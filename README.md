Fire Emblem Archive Tool (A tool to automatically extract data from 3DS Fire Emblem archives)

Credit to [ctpktool](https://github.com/polaris-/ctpktool) and [DSDecmp](https://github.com/einstein95/dsdecmp), from which code is used for ctpk unpacking and LZ decompression, respectively. 

Forked v1.1: Removed Prompt to rebuild text files, updated cptktool files so it would work instead of crashing and doing nothing, added a program icon.
